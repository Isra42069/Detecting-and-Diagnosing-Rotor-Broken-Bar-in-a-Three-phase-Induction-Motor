# Project Management Workbook

## 1. Project Overview
- **Project Name:** Detecting and Diagnosing Rotor Broken Bar in a Three-phase Induction Motor
- **SubProject:** Data Analysis and Fault Detection using MATLAB and IEEE dataset
- **Goal:** The project aims to design a detection and diagnostic system for rotor broken bar faults in three-phase induction motors using current and vibration analysis. The approach will combine MATLAB-based signal processing and machine learning methods on IEEE benchmark data. Deliverables include reproducible code, diagnostic visuals, and a detailed technical report.
- **Deliverables:** Proposal, Project, Report, Presentation, Workbook
   
- **Supervisor:** Rastko Zivanovic
- **Timeline:** October 2025 to January 2026
